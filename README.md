### üöÄ About the Project

The **Crypto Break-Even Price Calculator** is designed to help cryptocurrency investors determine their break-even price‚Äîthe price at which they neither gain nor lose money on their investment. The calculator takes into account:

- **Investment Amount**: The total amount invested in the cryptocurrency.
- **Purchase Price**: The average price at which the cryptocurrency was bought.
- **Current Price (Optional)**: The current market price of the cryptocurrency.

Using these inputs, the calculator computes the break-even price, helping users understand when their investment will become profitable.

Built with **ReactJS**, **TailwindCSS**, **React Router DOM**, **React Helmet**, and **React Snap**, this project offers a seamless user experience with SEO optimization for better visibility.
